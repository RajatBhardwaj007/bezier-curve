'''
Bezier curve python implementation by TimeTraveller.
(https://github.com/TimeTraveller-San)
Bezier curve was discovered by the French engineer Pierre BÃ©zier.

>> Set the control points by changing points.txt file

>> Parameters:
    - Speed: controls how fast will the plot be plotted
    - n: controls number of points we are plotting (higher the number, higher
      the resolution of the plot

>> Run mplot.py to actually plot the curve

>> Crude output points are stored in bpoints.txt. This is the file later read
   by matplot in mplot.py file to plot the curve
